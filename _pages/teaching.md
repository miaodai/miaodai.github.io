During my master's and Ph.D. studies, I have gained extensive and valuable teaching experience both as an instructor and teaching assistant at the University of Winnipeg and McGill University. I have taught an undergraduate course in Intermediate Microeconomics at the University of Winnipeg. While at McGill University, I serve as a teaching assistant both at the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) and [Max Bell School of Public Policy](https://www.mcgill.ca/maxbellschool/) .
