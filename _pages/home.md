Welcome to my page. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada. My research lies at the crossroads of Environmental and Resource Economics, Industrial Organziation, International Trade and Political Economy. I am currently working on how changes in ownership structure (cross-ownership and common ownership) might affect the strategic resource use and their implications for climate change. Also, I am investigating the role played by lobby groups on international trade in waste from a political economy approach.
