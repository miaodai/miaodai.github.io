Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada. I expect to graduate in 2023. My research lies at the crossroads of Environmental and Resource Economics, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Political Economy. 

I study market imperfections and their impacts on firm behaviour and the environment, focusing primarily on resource markets. In my job market paper, concerned by the growing North-to-South waste shipments and environmental degradation, I examine whether strengthening environmental lobby groups can represent an important strategy in reducing the international waste trade. To do so, I first develop a theoretical model, emphasizing the potential impact of environmental lobbies on environmental and trade policies and how waste trade flows are affected through these policy channels. Then, I bring theory to empirics to identify the causal effects of environmental lobbying on the waste trade.
