Welcome to my personal website!

I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://www.cee-m.fr/member/dai-miao/) at the [Center for Environmental Economics - Montpellier](https://www.cee-m.fr/) (CEE-M). I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada, in 2023.

I am a resource and environmental economist. I study various resource market distortions and their impacts on firmsâ€™ behaviour and the environment! My doctoral research focuses on two distinct market distortions: the influence of lobby groups in the international waste market and the presence of cross-ownership in the nonrenewable/renewable resource sector. Currently, I am investigating the role of critical minerals and their recycling in the transition to clean energy.
