Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Center for Environmental Economics - Montpellier](https://www.cee-m.fr/). I have finished my degree requirements for PhD in Economics from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada.

I am an environmental and resource economist. I study various resource market distortions and their impacts on firmsâ€™ behaviour and the environment! Specifically, my doctoral research focuses on two distinct market distortions: the presence of lobby groups in the international waste market and the presence of cross-ownership in the nonrenewable resource sector. 

My current research investigates the role of critical minerals and their recycling in the transition to clean energy. I am working with [Francesco Ricci](https://sites.google.com/view/francescoricci) and [Mouez Fohda](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/fodha) to develop a unified model to characterize the value chain involved in recycling, identifying the specific actors and analyzing their behaviour. Building on this analytical framework, we aim to progressively introduce potential market failures such as the emergence of natural monopoly at the stage of the recovery, negative externalities of primary production and waste disposal, positive externalities due to recycling, etc. This will allow us to provide guidance for public interventions in the value chain by identifying appropriate policy instruments to address these market failures. 



<!-- I will join the [School of Economics](http://eco.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) as an Assistant Professor in the summer of 2023. Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada. I expect to graduate in 2023. My research lies at the crossroads of Environmental and Resource Economics, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Political Economy. focuses on resource market imperfections caused by political lobbying and cross-ownership and their impacts on firm behaviour and the environment.-->
