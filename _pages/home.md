Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada. My main research interests are Environmental and Resource Economics, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Political Economy. 

I study market imperfections and their impact on firms behaviour and the environment, focusing primarily on resource markets. I am currently woking on how changes in ownership structure (e.g., cross-ownership and common ownership) will affect the strategic resource use and their implications for climate change. More specifically, motivated by the increasing cross-ownership transactions, I examine the impact of cross-ownership on market
outcomes when the scarcity and dynamics of the resources are taken into account. In another extension paper, I investigate the impact of cross-ownership among polluting oligopolists on the value of a clean substitute. 
 
My job market paper looks at the role of environmental lobbying in international waste trade.
