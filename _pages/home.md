Welcome to my personal website! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada. My research lies at the crossroads of Environmental and Resource Economics, Industrial Organziation, International Trade and Political Economy. 

My job market paper looks at the role played by lobby groups on international trade in waste from a political economy approach. I am also woking on how changes in ownership structure (e.g., cross-ownership and common ownership) will affect the strategic resource use and their implications for climate change.
