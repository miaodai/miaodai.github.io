Welcome to my website!

I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://www.cee-m.fr/member/dai-miao/) at the [Center for Environmental Economics - Montpellier](https://www.cee-m.fr/) (CEE-M). I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada, in 2023.

As an applied microeconomist, my primary research interests lie in environmental and resource economics, industrial organization, international trade, and dynamic games. My doctoral research focused on various resource market distortions and their impacts on firms’ behaviour and the environment. Specifically, I investigated two distinct market distortions: the influence of lobby groups in the international waste market and the presence of cross-ownership in the nonrenewable/renewable resource sector.

Currently, I am involved in two collaborative research projects that explore the role of critical minerals in the transition to clean energy. The first one is the France ANR-funded project: ScarCyclET – Materials Scarcity and Recycling for the Energy Transition, with [Francesco Ricci](https://sites.google.com/view/francescoricci) and [Mouez Fodha](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/fodha#page-perso-about); the other is the SNF-funded Project: Critical Minerals and the Clean Energy Transition, with [Joëlle Noailly](https://www.joellenoailly.com/), [Steven Poelhekke](https://sites.google.com/site/stevenpoelhekke/welcome), and [Gerard van derMeijden](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/gerard-van-der-meijden). The topics under investigation involve understanding the role of critical metals' recycling in their trade and geopolitical frictions, exploring the economic and policy implications of geopolitical challenges for the availability of critical minerals, and investigating policy solutions to mitigate environmental challenges posed by the mining and extraction of critical minerals, among many others.
