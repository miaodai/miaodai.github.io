My doctoral research has investigated how changes in ownership structure affect strategic resource use and their implications for climate change. More specifically, motivated by the increasing cross-ownership transactions, I examine the impact of cross-ownership on market outcomes when the resources' scarcity and dynamics are considered. In another extension paper, I investigate the impact of cross-ownership among polluting oligopolists on the value of a clean substitute.
